"""
This file defines a set of very simple models for testing custom fields.

No static timestamp field is defined here due to the large number of different keyword argument
combinations that need to be tested. The test moodel classes for the timestamp field are defined
dynamically in this module. A model is generated for each valid combination of field kwargs.

Due to the need to test the table structure and field value output into the database, I needed a
model instance for each possible timestamp field configuration. My options were:
    1. Statically define models in the tests models module
    2. Use type() to dynamically generate model classes directly in test cases
    3. Dynamically define model classes here in the models module

Option one seemed far too verbose, brittle, and tedious.

Option two was attempted but a problem was encountered. When using Django's django.test.TestCase
class, each test method is wrapped in a transaction. After defining a custom model class with
type(), one needs to actually migrate it into one or more databases to test table structure and
value insertion. DDL statements such as CREATE TABLE implicitly commit transactions in
MySQL/MariaDB. I overrode django.db.backends.base.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.sql_create_table to
create a TEMPORARY table instead and, altough this successfully created temp tables that could be
used, there is no way to verify the correct table structure as temp tables are not visible in the
information_schema. I could parse a SHOW CREATE TABLE <table_name> as it does acknowledge temp
tables but that just seemed too smelly, brittle, and desperate. Another option was to use
django.test.TransactionTestCase to avoid transactions altogether but, based on my experience, this
greatly slows down tests although I'm still considering it. Note that PostgreSQL supports
transactional DDL statements but unfortunately I can't just test PostgreSQL.

Option three, while less appealing to me due to the vast number of models cluttering up the models
module and making test DB setup and teardown slower, seems to work with Django's test infrastructure
rather than against it. I'll use it for now.

Note: The model class attribute "__module__" must be added to model class attributes because Django
    references it in DB system somewhere. Failing to define __module__ in the model will produce a
    KeyError:

        in __new__ module = attrs.pop('__module__')
