Add fields:
    Unsigned django.db.models.AutoField. Auto-increment fields will (should) never be negative.


Make note in README that MariaDB places parenthesis after functions in information_schema?
    Alternately, normalize table schema tests by stripping parentheses.

# Done in README.rst. Left here temporarily for reference in future work.
# Make note in readme about ORM behavior departing from that of underlying DB.
    TimestampField example:
        insert_values_dict={
            django.db.models.NOT_PROVIDED: None,
        }
        Attempting to save() model with field value django.db.models.NOT_PROVIDED should result in
            "field has no default" DB error but ORM does not allow value omission in write
            operations and will return empty string or None from Field._get_default, resulting in
            NULL insert. This behavior can be observed throughout ORM with many fields.

            Essentially, the generated SQL absolutely MUST have a value in the VALUES clause of an
            INSERT statement.


Add support for difference between DB engines in the FieldTestConfig.insert_values_dict tests.
    Use dict or allow expected values to be callables.
    Could simply trim all retrieved values insert_values_dict test method but this seems like it
        could introduce unexpected behavior in the future. I prefer to only use raw values.
    Example of the problem:
        When selecting a previously inserted empty string value in a CHAR field, PostgreSQL returns
        an empty string padded to max_length while MySQL and SQLite return an empty string.
Add FieldTestConfig.insert_values_dict empty string values.
    Test setting field value in constructor and by explicit setting model attribute.
    This cannot be maintainably accomplished until the above item is implemented.

Add separate tests for sets of stable database releases.
    For example: test MariaDB 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, etc.
    Add image "badges" to readme.
        Display latest test result on each database engine and version.
        Display latest test result on supported Django major releases.
    Implement using separate branches, each with different CI build script?
    Use Travis CI build matrix.
    Since tests iterate over settings DATABASE keys, add function in settings that checks for
        environment variables and will only add database keys that are "enabled." This, in
        combination with Travis, will allow the configuration of multiple tests against database
        engines and versions either one at a time or in sets. A maximum of one version of a given DB
        engine will be able to be tested in a given test iteration, however.

    Alternately, use Docker-enabled image?

Research possibility of using built-in DEFAULT clause generation for DDL instead of manual method.
