FixedCharField
    Ensure that null keyword argument in FixedCharField actually stores NULL in database?

TimestampField
    See if get_db_prep_save quotes return values as well
    Add validation for TIMESTAMP MySQL valid date storage range?
        https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/timestamp/
        It can hold values starting at '1970-01-01 00:00:01' (UTC) to
            '2038-01-19 05:14:07' (UTC) . This range is caused by MariaDB
            storing the TIMESTAMP values as the number of seconds since
            '1970-01-01 00:00:00' (UTC).
