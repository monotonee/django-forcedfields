In readme:
    Why Oracle is not tested
        Huge download
            Also required for Docker image
        Not in package managers
        Rarely used
        I hate Oracle

    Backends for which "char" field seem valid:
        mysql
        oracle
        postgresql
        sqlite3
        SQL anywhere
        IBM DB2
        MS SQL Server
        Firebird

    Backend behavior for timestamp field
        MySQL/MariaDB CURRENT_TIMESTAMP default
        Postgre timestamp without timezone (default Django behavior)
        sqlite3 datetime (default Django behavior)
        Oracle?

Before release:
    Run style checker and linter
