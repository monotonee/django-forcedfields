"""
Defines custom Django ORM model fields designed to force field data types in the database.

Databases should be as self-documenting and semantic as possible, independent of any application
code, ORM models, or documentation. To that end, this module aims to force the ORM to conduct more
explicit database operations and to shift duties from the application to the database where
appropriate and consistent with best practices.

Django's documentation concerning the creation of custom model fields is cursory and unclear and the
method names are needlessly vague. As I understand it, the following is a very rough overview of the
flow of Field API method calls in order starting with fetching data FROM the database and ending
with returning data TO the database:

    1. from_db_value
    2. to_python
        - "Convert the input value into the expected Python data type"
        - Usually not called by the SQL compilers directly. Used internally by the Field classes.
    3. pre_save
        - "Return field's value just before saving."
        - Called by the SQL compilers to fetch the value of the model's field attribute for the
            first time before eventually being passed to the Field's *_prep_value() methods.
        - See source for django.db.models.sql.SQLCompiler.pre_save_val()
    4. get_prep_value
        - "Perform preliminary non-db specific value checks and conversions."
        - Seems to be used internally by the Field classes. Doesn't seem to be called directly by
            SQL compilers.
    5. get_db_prep_value
        - "Return field's value prepared for interacting with the database backend."
        - Seems to be used internally by the Field classes. Doesn't seem to be called directly by
            SQL compilers.
        - For example, this is called by base Field class' get_db_prep_save().
    6. get_db_prep_save
        - "Return field's value prepared for saving into a database."
        - Called directly by SQL compilers.
        - See source for django.db.models.sql.SQLCompiler.prepare_value().
        - Called in django.db.models.sql.compiler.SQLInsertCompiler.prepare_value()

defer to Google's style guide. I use Google's doc block and inline comment formatting standards.

        Default values in Django's ORM are (sigh) usually applied in the application layer in a

class FixedCharField(django.db.models.CharField, DefaultValueMixin):
    """
    A custom Django ORM field class that stores values in fixed-length "CHAR" database fields.

    Django's core CharField class saves all values in VARCHAR data types with no option to use a
    CHAR data type instead.

    CharField's max_length kwarg is kept for simplicity. In this class, the value of max_length will
    be the length of the CHAR field.

    If the parent CharField is not given a value in a model instance, a blank string will be
    inserted when Model.save() is called. That behavior is completely incorrect. This class
    overrides that behavior and will more correctly attempt to insert a NULL value.

    The Django ORM either doesn't allow one to omit a value for a field during INSERT or I simply
    have not yet figured out how to do it. The ORM seems to absolutely require and depend upon a
    value for a field in a model at insert/update time, regardless of whether or not an explicit
    "default" kwarg value was passed to the CharField's constructor or an explicit value was defined
    on the model's field attribute.

    Obviously, it would be best to omit a value altogether and let the underlying DB handle it
    when no value and no default value is defined for the field in a model. But, since that seems
    impossible, the next best course of action is to insert a NULL value as it is semantically
    congruent with unknown or absent data, unlike an empty string.

    Despite its bad, vague name given its use in the Django ORM field classes, empty_strings_allowed
    seems to only affect Field._get_default() and does not seem to restrict field values in model
    definition or at runtime. It is still possible to insert an empty string by providing the value
    to model instance's __init__() method for the field, assigning an empty string to a model's
    field attribute, and by explicitly specifying an empty string for the field's "default" kwarg.

class TimestampField(django.db.models.DateTimeField, DefaultValueMixin):
    """
    A custom Django ORM field class designed for use as a timezone-free system timestamp field.

    System timestamps are intended to record system-level events and timezone-independent moments in
    time. They contribute to database and record metadata.

    See:
        http://stackoverflow.com/a/410458

    MySQL/MariaDB supports the TIMESTAMP data type which includes special modifiers to ease its use
    as a system utility. These include the ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP modifier which essentially
    creates an implicit trigger. Django uses MySQL's DATETIME data type by default while this class
    overrides this and uses MySQL's TIMESTAMP data type instead.

    Warning:
        When using the MySQL backend, the database TIMESTAMP field will also be updated when
        auto_now or auto_now_update is True and when calling QuerySet.update(). In constrast,
        Django's DateField and DateTimeField only set current timestamp under auto_now when calling
        Model.save().

    See:
        https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#datefield
        https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/timestamp/
        https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/mysql/base.py

    PostgreSQL does not have anything resembling ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP aside from custom
    triggers. However, its equivalent of MySQL's DATETIME data type is "timestamp", which does
    include the option to save without timezone. This explciit lack of timezone most closely aligns
    with the intended use case of this field class and is therefore used.

        auto_now_update and auto_now exclusivity.

        auto_now, auto_now_add, and default all logically define a DEFAULT clause and are therefore

        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP values are automatically applied depending upon server configuration.
        Enable the "explicit_defaults_for_timestamp" server system variable to disable this. See
        README for more details.

        At minimum, a DEFAULT clause must be specified in order to be compatible with MySQL server
        system variable explicit_defaults_for_timestamp. MySQL strict mode, NO_ZERO_DATE,
        NO_ZERO_IN_DATE, and explicit_defaults_for_timestamp all affect what values and defaults are
        valid and it is the user's responsibility to effect the desired database behavior by setting

        which finally calls to_python(), which in turn raises ValidationError if date parse fails.

        The SQL compiler (django.db.models.sql.compiler.SQLInsertCompiler) calls this method on
        fields to get the value to be inserted in the SQL insert VALUES list.
